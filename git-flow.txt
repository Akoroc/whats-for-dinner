# Git Flow Example Workflow (Slightly more advanced)

# 1. Starting a new branch and switching to it

git checkout -b feature/some-feature-name

# or alternatively

git branch feature/some-feature-name
git checkout feature/some-feature-name

# 2. Follow your usual git workflow within your branch

git add -A
git commit -m "add styles for sidebar"

# ...

# 3. Pushing up your branch

git push origin feature/some-feature-name

# > 4. Create Pull Request on Github, get a team mate to review it

# > 5. Merge to the main branch on Github

# > 6. Delete branch on github after merge. Inform your team mates

# Pulling latest chages on the main branch

# 7. First, switch to the main branch

git checkout main

# 8. Pull latest changes

git pull origin main

# 9. Delete your old feature branch (Github only deletes the remote branch, not the local one)

git branch -d feature/some-feature-name

# Continue from step 1. for new changes!
